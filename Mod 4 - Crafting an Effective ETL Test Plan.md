# Crafting an Effective ETL Test Plan

In the exerices we will work in our groups to develop an ETL Test plan for the Wide World Importers database.

We will use Microsoft SSIS and the ETL packages that Microsoft provide for this system. The ETL does bulk load and the tool is designed to run daily


## ETL Test plan outline

You Test plan should consist of the following sections

* A clear definition of the objectives of the test.
* A detailed description of the source and target systems.
* A list of the data to be tested.
* A list of the test cases and their objectives.
* A schedule for executing the tests.
