# Data Trust Case Studies
To understand the importance of data trust, it helps to see it in action. The following case studies demonstrate use cases that are common across a range of organisations, from private companies to public institutions:

## Beneva – Achieving data trust to better serve and retain three million customers
Canada’s largest mutual insurance company, Beneva (formerly SSQ Insurance) serves three million customers with a full range of insurance and investment products. As can happen after 75 years in business, the company found its data systems had grown too complex and siloed to use customer data effectively.

While financial and insurance clients expect a high level of personalisation, employees could not see customer data across lines of business. “If you called about another product, it was as if we didn’t know you at all,” says Simon Latouche, Director of Data Engineering at Beneva.

To put healthy data at the heart of its business and improve data sharing, Beneva created a unified customer portal. It automatically registers customers’ operations, and Talend Data Quality and Data Stewardship make sure the data is trustworthy. Now employees have access to comprehensive, trusted customer data. As a result, call centres can help customers more efficiently and marketers can customise campaigns with predictive models. In fact, Beneva was able to increase customer win-back conversions by threefold.

## Aeroporti Di Roma — analysing Data for 48.8 Million Travellers in Compliance with GDPR
Aeroporti Di Roma (ADR) manages and develops Roma Fiumicino (Leonardo da Vinci) and Ciampino airports. Nearly 100 airlines operate from these airports, carrying passengers to more than 230 destinations worldwide.

ADR knows how critical trusted data is to understanding and anticipating customer behaviours at speed. They also understand their responsibility to protect personal data for their customers. To improve data sharing while still ensuring safeguards for personal data, ADR and its partners built a Big Data Analytics platform using Cloudera for the data lake and Talend Big Data for the ingestion engine. Pietro Caminiti, Head of IT Solutions for Aeroporti Di Roma SpA, reports excellent results: "With Talend, we can analyse large data volumes in order to extract strategic information through advanced statistical algorithms while also complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) standards."

"We have improved our 48.8 million passengers’ experience and operation’s efficiency,” says Pietro Caminiti. “And we have been recognised as Europe’s number one airport with over 40 million passengers, according to ACI World’s globally-established Airport Service Quality programme.”

## Wolters Kluwer Health — Paving the way for healthier business decisions
Wolters Kluwer Health provides professional information, services, and solutions for the healthcare industry. When the company’s appetite for trusted data threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the business intelligence (BI) staff, they launched an innovative “Citizen Analyst” initiative to democratise the use of data.

Talend had the combination of modularity, scalability, simplicity, cost efficiency, and support for extremely high data quality that Wolters Kluwer Health needed to achieve its immediate goals and long-term vision for the initiative. The shift to Talend has saved millions of dollars and also allowed the BI team to use advanced, predictive analytics and AI to find new patterns in data that facilitate better decision making.

The Citizen Analyst initiative has helped non-technical staff do their own data analysis using simple interfaces, easy-to-use tools and high-quality data — all integrated by Talend — to drive better patient care and healthier business decisions.

“We’re creating a culture of curiosity,” explains Kevin Ryan, Director of Business Intelligence at Wolters Kluwer Health. “That’s a cultural shift, but it’s a change that people are embracing because everyone wins. Product teams get insights sooner, they are less dependant on the BI team, they can share results with business leaders and get buy-in faster, and ultimately the outcome is better products and services that benefit doctors and patients.”
